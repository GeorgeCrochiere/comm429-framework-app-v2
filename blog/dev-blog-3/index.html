<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>There are various reasons as to why one may create a personalized blog, with most professional ones being hosted on their own server. This individual hosting allows for more control over one's own data. While the initial server may require a bit of programming setup, the installation of <a href="https://wordpress.org/">WordPress</a> can be used to make a personalized blog easier. WordPress can be used to allow for a larger focus on creativity without the worry of knowing how to program every component.</p>
<p>With Linux-based systems being one of the largest options for operating systems on servers, let's assume you've created a Linux-based server and successfully installed WordPress with their <a href="https://developer.wordpress.org/advanced-administration/before-install/howto-install/">installation guide</a>; great job! <strong>However, as you start playing around with WordPress, you might encounter a situation where you can't upload any images.</strong></p>
<p><img src="../../src/assets/img/ErrorWP.png" alt="Upload Error in WordPress due to permissions."></p>
<p class="imgQuote">Upload Error in WordPress due to permissions.</p>
<p>Images are essential to several blog posts to allow for better engagement with viewers and to provide a visualization or more clear description of what you are writing about in your paragraph. In this article, we will go over a potential fix on how to get image uploads working.</p>

<h2>Prerequisites</h2>
<p>If you need help in terms on developing a server to run WordPress on, the following articles by <a href="https://www.digitalocean.com/">DigitalOcean</a> provides several ways to establish a server. This example utilized the following:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/initial-server-setup-with-ubuntu-22-04">Installation of the initial server</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-the-apache-web-server-on-ubuntu-22-04">Installation of Apache2</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-linux-apache-mysql-php-lamp-stack-on-ubuntu-22-04">Installation of the LAMP (Linux, Apache, MySQL, PHP) Stack</a>
<ul>
<li><strong>Note:</strong> This file was only followed after step 2 with other MySQL Settings being altered.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>For the purposes of this article, it'll be assumed that the following is how your WordPress installation in set up. It will be assumed that the domain you are using is <code>example.com</code>, using a Virtual Host housed in the folder <code>example</code>:</p>
<pre><code>/var/www
    │
    ├── example
    │   ├── blog
    │   │   ├── index.php
    │   │   ├── license.txt
    │   │   ├── readme.html
    │   │   ├── wp-activate.php
    │   │   ├── wp-admin
    │   │   ├── wp-blog-header.php
    │   │   ├── wp-comments-post.php
    │   │   ├── wp-config.php
    │   │   ├── wp-content
    │   │   ├── wp-cron.php
    │   │   ├── wp-includes
    │   │   ├── wp-links-opml.php
    │   │   ├── wp-load.php
    │   │   ├── wp-login.php
    │   │   ├── wp-mail.php
    │   │   ├── wp-settings.php
    │   │   ├── wp-signup.php
    │   │   ├── wp-trackback.php
    │   │   └── xmlrpc.php
    │   ├── index.html
    │   └── user_list.php
    └── html
        └── index.html
</code></pre>

<p>This example houses the WordPress installation within the <code>blog</code> directory, which only adds &quot;/blog&quot; to the URL. WordPress also has the option to be installed directly in the Virtual Host folder. Regardless of which folder is utilized for WordPress, the folder will be called the <strong>parent</strong> directory.</p>

<h2>The Error</h2>
<p>To recap, the error present occurs when one tries to upload an image, yet WordPress doesn't have the permissions to upload. This return the following error message:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><code>Unable to create directory wp-content/uploads/&lt;year&gt;/&lt;month&gt;. Is the parent directory writable by the server?</code></p>
</blockquote>
<p><img src="../../src/assets/img/ErrorWP.png" alt="Upload Error in WordPress due to permissions."></p>
<p class="imgQuote">Upload Error in WordPress due to permissions.</p>
<p>Now that you have your WordPress installed on your server, let's discuss how the error occured. When the WordPress was initially installed, it was likely done while the installer was utilizing the root user of the server. Regardless of exactly how it was done, the directories that contain WordPress data need to be modified.</p>
<p>For this example, we can view the file permissions by first navigating to the <code>/var/www/example</code> directory, then listing the items with permission data.</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">cd /var/www/example
ls -al
</code></pre>
<p>This produces the following results:</p>
<pre><code>total 20
drwxr-xr-x 3 root root 4096 Apr 15 15:07 .
drwxr-xr-x 4 root root 4096 Apr 11 18:50 ..
drwxr-xr-x 5 root root 4096 Apr 15 15:15 blog
-rwxr-xr-x 1 root root  151 Apr  2 18:30 index.html
-rwxr-xr-x 1 root root  416 Apr  9 17:58 user_list.php
</code></pre>
<p>This outputs data associated with content in the directory, with the <code>-l</code> tag, as specified in <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/22086175/understanding-ls-output">this StackOverflow thread</a>, giving the following data regarding each file:</p>
<ul>
<li>Permissions</li>
<li>Number of Hardlinks</li>
<li>File Owner</li>
<li>File Group</li>
<li>File Size</li>
<li>Date &amp; Time of Last Modification</li>
<li>Filename</li>
</ul>
<p>The main issue lies with the directory's owner and group data. Additionally, while this is the output for this specific instance, there is a chance that the permissions for each file is not the same, or is not what is needed for WordPress to function.</p>
<hr>
<p><a name="fix"></a></p>
<h2>The Solution</h2>
<p>To fix this issue, we need to modify the file group, file owner, and file permissions for the directory and its components. This can be done with a couple of commands.</p>
<p>For the commands to be executed, we need to be in the directory above the WordPress directory. In this examples case, the <code>blog</code> directory is the direcctory that contains the WordPress files. This means we need to be located in the directory <code>example</code>, which contains the blog directory. If the VirtualHost folder <code>example</code> contains the WordPress files directly, then we need to be in the <code>www</code> directory.</p>
<p>In terms of file permissions, while WordPress requires its files to have the permission levels of <strong>644</strong>, this post will set the permission levels to <strong>755</strong>. This can be changed later on with the same command, only replacing the number. <a href="https://www.theserverside.com/blog/Coffee-Talk-Java-News-Stories-and-Opinions/how-permissions-chmod-with-numbers-command-explained-777-rwx-unix">More information on how the permission number is generated can be found here</a>.</p>

<h3>Steps to Fix File Permissions and Ownsership:</h3>
<ol>
<li>Navigate to the directory containing the WordPress folder, as specified in the above paragraphs.</li>
</ol>
<pre><code class="language-bash">cd /var/www/example
</code></pre>
<ol start="2">
<li>Change the ownsership and grouping of the WordPress directory and it's inner components. If your WordPress folder is not <code>blog</code>, you can change the folder's name</li>
</ol>
<pre><code class="language-bash">sudo chown -R www-data blog/
sudo chgrp -R www-data blog/
</code></pre>
<ol start="3">
<li>Change the permissions of the directory and it's contents to a permission level of <strong>755</strong>.</li>
</ol>
<pre><code class="language-bash">sudo chmod -R 755 blog/
</code></pre>
<ol start="4">
<li>Finally, restart Apache2 on the server to let the changes take effect.</li>
</ol>
<pre><code class="language-bash">systemctl restart apache2
</code></pre>
<p>You can now go back into WordPress, refresh the page, and start uploading items into the media page.</p>

<h3>Alternate Solutions</h3>
<p>If the above solution does not work, there are other solutions present. Check out <a href="https://wp-me.com/fix-unable-to-create-directory-wp-content-uploads-is-its-parent-directory-writable-by-the-server/">this possible option</a> that focuses on database connections, but will also require the use of <a href="https://www.phpmyadmin.net/">phpMyAdmin</a>.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Images can always help improve a blog post or webpage by providing additional visual details to media content, but it typically helps if images can be added to the page in the first place. While programming a site will prevent this issue from occuring with HTML pages as a programmer, using WordPress can open new opportunites to making creative projects, or providing access to creative front-ends without worry about programming each section.</p>
<p>Happy Coding!</p>
